        <h1>The Differences between writing in HTML verses in Google Docs</h1>
            <p>Within the last 5 weeks of this course I have been able to learn more about HTML and understand the similarities and differences between writing in Google Docs versus in HTML.</p>
        <h3>Google Docs Key Features</h3>
            <p>In google docs it the overall UI looks very different and more intuitive than writing in HTML. There are more buttons and clear indications of what to do when you need to do a certain task. For example, in google docs if you need to make a text in bold you can simple select the text you would like to bold and click the "B" button. You are also able to automatically see visually what you are writing and designing into the Doc. Google Docs has a much more shallow learning curve compared to HTML, however there is less customizability.</p>
        <h3>HTML Key Features</h3>
            <p>In HTML the UI looks very blank and confusing to a user who does not understand how to code. It has a "blank slate" kind of feel to it since there are no visual buttons, drag and drops, or automatic visualization. However, HTML has more a lot more to offer than it seems. With the ability of understanding how to code and write in it properly there is much more room for customizability and formatting options. The options for creativity and customizability are endless. But, it does have a much steeper learning curve as you need to know how to code in order to use it. </p>
